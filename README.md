📊 Data Retrieval: I have fetched real-time data on the top 10 cryptocurrencies using the CoinMarketCap API. This data will include a number of metrics such as price, market cap, and percent changes over various timeframes.

🔗 Data Normalization and Storage: The retrieved data was normalized using Pandas into a structured format, which was then stored in a CSV file. The intention here is data quality and ease of analysis and visualization later.

🎨 Data Visualization: I created a set of visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib. This will highlight a lot of the key patterns and trends in cryptocurrency performances over an hour, a day, and a week.

📈 Statistical Analysis: It then applies various statistical methods to help gain insight into the average percentage changes of such cryptocurrencies, useful in understanding the state of trends.

📝 Conclusion: This is a project explaining how to analyze and visualize cryptocurrency data. It further prepared me in handling and presenting data, so that even very intricate analyses may be passed on in an easily understandable form.
